# potatOS

This is a hobby operating system being build from scratch..

It's paused for now because of graduation reasons.

BTW - You could actually keep track the development process from here (if you interested) : 

- [potatOS.org](https://saeeedhany.github.io/potatos.org/) 

> It is new so it doesn't actually have any real content, I add content gradually
