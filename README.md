# potatOS

**potatOS** is a hobby operating system built from scratch for learning and experimentation.

The project focuses on understanding operating system internals, from the boot process to core kernel components, by implementing everything manually and documenting the journey.

## Documentation

All development steps and technical notes are documented incrementally.
